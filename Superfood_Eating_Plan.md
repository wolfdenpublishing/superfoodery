# Ron's Superfood Eating Plan

## Overview

This document defines a personalized eating framework focused on evidence-based "superfoods"—whole, unprocessed foods with documented anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and health-promoting properties. The goal is to support meal planning, recipe generation, and shopping list creation for an individual following this approach.

---

## Profile & Goals

### Eating Pattern
- **Primary Pattern**: OMAD (One Meal A Day) Intermittent Fasting
- **Meal Structure**: One primary meal per day, occasionally followed by a small snack a few hours later
- **Fasting**: Extended fasting between eating windows; body is well-adapted to this pattern

### Calorie Targets
| Phase | Daily Calories | Duration |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Fat Loss | ~1,500 | Current phase, approximately 30 days |
| Transition | ~2,000 | Following fat loss phase |
| Maintenance | ~2,500 | Long-term stable weight |

### Weight Goal
- **Target**: 165 lb (body naturally stabilizes at this weight when eating clean)

### Weekly Structure
- **6 days**: Follow the superfood eating plan at target calories
- **1 day**: "Free day" with unrestricted eating (important for metabolic signaling and psychological sustainability)

## Food Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Clean Eating**: Foods should be actual whole foods without fillers, preservatives, or artificial additives
2. **Shop the Edges**: Focus on perimeter of grocery store (produce, proteins, dairy) rather than processed center aisles
3. **Evidence-Based Superfoods**: Prioritize foods with documented health benefits—anti-inflammatory effects, antioxidant activity, cardiovascular benefits, or specific beneficial bioactive compounds
4. **Prep from Scratch**: Cook and prepare foods from raw ingredients whenever possible

### Physical Response to Clean Eating
The individual experiences noticeable physiological differences when eating clean vs. processed foods:
- Reduced edema/swelling (especially in hands)
- Increased energy
- Reduced sleep requirement with improved sleep quality
- These effects are noticeable within a few days of returning to clean eating

## Notes for Meal Planning AI

When helping plan meals with this document:

1. **Respect the OMAD pattern**: Plan one substantial meal plus optional small snack
2. **Hit the nutritional coverage targets**: Use the checklist to ensure variety
3. **Honor preferences**: No sardines, anchovies, Brazil nuts; yogurt is the preferred fermented food
4. **Embrace spice**: Hispanic heritage, loves heat, has homemade habañero powder
5. **Batch prep mindset**: Suggest components that can be prepped once and assembled differently throughout the week
6. **Shopping list should be Walmart-realistic**: Most items should be available there
7. **Calorie awareness**: Know which phase (1500/2000/2500) and portion accordingly
8. **Variety matters**: Even perfect foods get boring if repeated daily; rotate proteins, grains, and preparations
9. **Quality fat sourcing**: Fresh Harvest for olive oil; use as finishing oil, not high-heat cooking
10. **Flavor is non-negotiable**: Food should taste excellent, not just be nutritious
